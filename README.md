Scaffolded by create-react-app

Current functionality:
- Following tutorial at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/part1-simple-extension

Future Ideas:
- remove "and also" from all text everywhere.
- get rid of ugly outline in MS Edge when I click things.
- create a Mad Lib from a page.
- create a useful quiz from a Wikipedia article.
- set site-specific css (hide sidebar in stackoverflow)
- custom functions with highlighted text (read aloud, add question, add reference)
- set rewards and actions, like bing, but something useful for yself, like an ongoing RPG, Thy Dungeonman
- ability to highlight "out of the box" and use a hotkey or context menu to hyphenate it to "out-of-the-box".
- See if any Reddit posts link to the page in your current address bar. (lots of ideas about this, check for waybackmachine vversions, and if reddit links to the waybackmachine version of it, see if another site links here, see if )
- Rainbow selection, each char is highlihgted in the next color of the rainbow. See if it can be gradient, etc. 
- Don't let me click immediately after a UI change. I hate it when I try to click something, and the page changes around right as I click, and another thing is now under my pointer, and I click that by accident. Happens especially in Gmail. 
- Determine whether a letter is an I, an L, or the digit 1. Possibly exentend to identifying long dash vs hyphen, decode URL or HTML encoded characters, etc. 
- Save tabs as list of urls to a txt file.
